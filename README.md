The Hotel Silverpeak Booking System is a secure, user-friendly web application that revolutionizes hotel reservations by enabling real-time room availability checks, instant bookings (Standard/Family/Suite), and hassle-free cancellations. Developed with PHP and MySQL for robust backend operations, and enhanced with responsive HTML5/CSS3 for seamless mobile/desktop access, the system implements a smart two-phase reservation process with automated pricing calculations and session-based transaction security. Its optimized database architecture ensures data integrity while advanced security protocols (prepared statements, input validation) protect against threats. Designed for scalability, the platform serves as an all-in-one digital solution for modern hotels, with potential for expansion to include online payments and customer portals.
